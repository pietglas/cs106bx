This project contains my solutions for some of the homework exercises given out by the courses CS106B/X from Stanford, given in some previous year. The webpages of the courses can be found at:

- CS106B (spring 2018): https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1186/
- CS106X (autumn 2019): http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106x/

Solutions may be incomplete and contain mistakes. Sometimes I wanted to refrain from using the Standford library, and used functions from STL and/or other external libraries instead.
